# Using API routes form Next.js to verify the token generated by client using the Google Recaptcha API. Here are being used token recaptcha V3 and V2 at the same time.

## V2

- Generate a token and, if the user is suspect, shows a recaptcha challenge to select squares.
- **Validation:** Will return success if the user answer correctly the challenge.
- **UX**: If the user is suspect (it's frequently) appears a challenge box to select squares. It's annoying, but doing that, can continue.

## V3

- Generate a token and send to the backend. The backend will verify the score from this token (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Validation:** You can use the score in the backend to verify the user access, verifying a minimum score acceptable.
- **UX**: user can't see a challenge, so it's a "automatic" flow for him. But if the score fails, he can't do nothing.
